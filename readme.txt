Use OpenAI.com's natural language processing features to provide more information about posts.

== Description ==

[OpenAI.com](https://openai.com) provides natural-language-processing (NLP) capabilities that encompass a large amount of general knowledge. This plugin provides a shortcode to access that knowledge and present it in posts. It uses the content of each post to prompt the NLP.

It may be possible, given a big enough OpenAI budget, to train an NLP model on a large fraction of a site's content. That might make the tell-me-more content even more useful.

Users of the plugin must provide their own API keys (and pay their own service bills).

== Installation ==

Install and activate this plugin in the usual way.

Visit its admin page (in Settings > Tell Me More) to enter the API key and configure its operation.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= A question that someone might have =

An answer to that question.

= What about foo bar? =

directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
